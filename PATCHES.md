# Contributing

First and foremost: keep it civil.

We're all doing this for fun, please treat others with respect.

## Commit Style

*   Make commits of logical units.
*   Do not modify piece of code not related to your commit.
*   Do not try to fix style of code you are not writing, it's just adding noise
    for no gain and may interfere with user config modifications.
*   Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" before commiting.
*   Do not check in commented out code or unneeded files.
*   Provide a meaningful commit messages.
*   The first line of the commit message should be a short description.
